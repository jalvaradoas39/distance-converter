# Distance Converter Program

## Description
This project was a school assignment for my Java programming course. The task was to write a Java program with a graphical interface that allows the user to convert a distance from inches to centimeters or from centimeters to inches. The user interface needed to include the following elements:

- A text box to enter the amount to be converted.
- A combo box to select between inches to centimeters or centimeters to inches.
- A button to perform the conversion.
- A label to display the conversion result.

The program uses a conversion rate where 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters.

## What I Learned
This assignment introduced me to several Swing GUI components and concepts in Java that were very helpful to understand. Here are a few key points I learned:

- **Swing GUI Components**: I became familiar with using `JTextField`, `JLabel`, `JButton`, `JFrame`, `JTable`,`JFileChooser`, and other components in the Swing library to create an interactive graphical interface. Understanding how to use these components was essential to build a user-friendly application.

- **ActionListeners**: Although I was already familiar with using event listeners and event handlers in JavaScript, it was interesting to see how these concepts are implemented in Java. In Java, a GUI may contain multiple ActionListeners, and it is essential to specify the correct ActionListener for each action event. This way, the program can respond correctly to user inputs.
